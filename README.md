### About me
Hi, my name is Parnika and I am a Freshman the the University of North Caroliona at Charlotte. I am a double major in Math and Data Science, math has always been my favorite subject since elemetary schools! I'm excited to continue learning about the ins and out of Data Science and how it connects to the world around us. Some of my hobbies include listening to music, hangingout with friends and doing anything fun.

#### Why is learning data science in social and interdiciplinary contexts matters
To answer this question we first need to know what is data science, it is the study of fields that use scientific methods, process, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combine statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to solve problems and drive decisions. While it may not seem like it data science is used for many things in our day to day life, such as our FYP (for you page) in instagram, tiktok or even the advertisments we see. So why should we modle social topics and people, well for starters these are things that make up our society on a daily so its good to know some information on them. It helps us gain objective insights and helps optimize resource allocation for social good, these data driven solutions help solve complex social problems and help make more infomred decision. While solving these problems are important it is also important to take into account the information we are taking, we need to make sure that the peoples information is not put at jepordy, we can't let biases determine the conclusion of data along with not using overly sensetive imformation about individuals. In this course I hope ot learn more about how to create algorithims to make models along with just learning anything new!
