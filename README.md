### About me
Hi, my name is Parnika and I am a Freshman the the University of North Caroliona at Charlotte. I am a double major in Math and Data Science, math has always been my favorite subject since elemetary schools! I'm excited to continue learning about the ins and out of Data Science and how it connects to the world around us. Some of my hobbies include listening to music, hangingout with friends and doing anything fun.
